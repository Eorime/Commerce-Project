This small project was created as part of Harvard's web programming course, with a focus on the backend development of a 
website using Python's Django and SQLite.
It includes features such as user registration and authorization, allowing users to create accounts and log in. 
Users can list products for sale, providing detailed descriptions and images. The website also supports a commenting system, 
enabling users to leave comments on product listings. Additionally, a bidding feature allows users to place bids on listed products. 
A Django admin panel is included to facilitate the management of users, products, and other backend functionalities. This project showcases
essential backend development skills and demonstrates the integration of key features required for a dynamic web application.
